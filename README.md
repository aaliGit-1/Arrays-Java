>maxPizza.java<br>
Alice and Bob are batch mates and Alice got placed in a well-reputed productbased company and his friend Bob is demanding a pizza party from him. Alice is

Bob is on dieting, and he can only eat pizza of at most k-1 flavors but he can eat as many pizzas of ith flavor and he wanted to choose maximum possible pizzas which are in contiguous sequence to one another such that all pizzas in sequence has atmost k-1 flavors.<br>
Input: <br>
6, 2 -> Size of input Array and K distinct flavors<br>
111221 -> input array (N Different pizza flavors )<br>
Output:<br>
3  (Maximum length subarray with at most k-1 distinct flavors is 3 and sub array is 1 1 1)<br>
